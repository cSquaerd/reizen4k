			\section{Setting \& History}
			It is two millennia into the future. Humanity’s supremacy over Earth has dwindled, due largely in part to the Great Exodus and the onset of Era of Magic. The Exodus occurred sometime in the 25th century, where massive fleets of starships lifted off to relocate much of the human population following a grueling intrasystem war. Though successful in saving the species, it reduced the planetside human population from 3 billion to under 500 million. \linebreak

			As a result, many civilizations faded as those who remained clustered in non-equatorial coastal cities, as the Great Aridization was at its peak; temperatures in equatorial regions reached 140F on average, and many desert regions expanded and invaded at an unprecedented rate. Migration was so extreme that the American continent regained mythic status among some, as did Australia, North Africa, The Eurasian Steppe, and Antarctica, due to the lack of human presence there for the second half of the 2nd millennia. \vfill \null \columnbreak

			Though the human population did increase to around 1.5 billion by the 3rd millennia, so too did other populations. A combination of radioactive fallout from the multiple wars and accidents, and the awakening of magical forces, spurred the evolution of large mammals and small reptiles, which gave rise to Beast-Folk in the aforementioned abandoned continents. Though apprehensive at first, humans and beasts came to coexist in time, though xenophobia on both sides still resides in some circles. \linebreak

			As mentioned before, forces and powers once resigned to fiction began manifesting following the Exodus. A select group of humans and beasts were found to be able to shoot flames from thin air, lift objects without moving a finger, and heal all manner of diseases and wounds with a simple touch, and even turn themselves invisible. Though a rare feat, the five to ten percent of sentients capable of magic are overall benign, with the Order of International Mages holding sound dominion over all things arcane. \vfill \null \columnbreak

			Even with all the odd and amazing revelations of the past, much from the Era of Humans remains lost or undiscovered across the world. Many ancient bunkers remain, many from the 21st and 22nd centuries, and in near working order. Within their depths, armies of autonomous machines stand vigilant protecting the secrets of their creators, and, at times, do so aggressively. \linebreak

			They are not alone in their malevolence; Rogue mages, practitioners of necromancy or daemon communion, prowl the wastelands on the fringes of civilization; Feral Beast-Folk stalk the mountains, caves, and forests born anew after the Great Aridization; and, worst of all, certain "cursed" locations remain hotbeds for daemon interlopers, extra-dimensional aberrations that seek to kill or consume everything in their path. \linebreak

			Much awaits adventurers in this world, and in worlds beyond...

			\section{Misc. Notes \& Gameplay Rules}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Skills work off a bonus-points system, where a player can spend skill points during level-up to further buff skills of theirs. When rolling for a skill, a player with bonus points can add said points and the skill's associated ability score modifier to the roll. Skill points are alotted as follows:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Points at Level 1: \linebreak $4 \times \big(2 \; + \max(\text{Int. mod.}, \text{ Wis. mod.})\big)$
					\item Points every higher level: \linebreak $2 \; + \max(\text{Int. mod.}, \text{ Wis. mod.})$
				\end{itemize}
				Skill points can also be earned by taking sessions with skill trainers over the course of a player's journey
				\item For character generation, ability scores can be determined by any one of the three following methods:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Six $D20$: Roll six $D20$ dice and distribute the rolls to your ability scores
					\item Four-Drop-Lowest $D6$: Roll four $D6$ and discard the lowest roll. Repeat six times, and then distribute the sums of the rolls to your ability scores
					\item Point-Buy: Start all ability scores at 8. Given 27 points to distribute, increase scores up to a maximum of 15 until exactly 27 points are spent. One score increase costs one point up until a score of 13; Increasing a score from 13 to 14 costs two points, as does increasing a score from 14 to 15. For example, a score of 10 costs 2 points, 12 costs 4 points, 14 costs 7 points.

			\section{Minigames}

			\subsection{D'vadtsat}

			\subsubsection{Rules}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Setup: Find two players. Draw four side-deck cards from your personal side deck. Flip a coin or play Rock Paper Scissors to determine who takes the first turn in the first round.
				\item Objective: Be the first player to win 3 Rounds. To win a round, you must deal up to 9 cards such that one of the following score conditions is met:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Your cards sum up to 20 (ties possible)
					\item Your cards sum up to more than your opponent's cards
					\item You play 9 cards with a sum less than or equal to 20 (beats a 20-sum of 8 cards or less); If both players accomplish this, see the previous condition
				\end{itemize}
				\item Round Play:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item During a round, players take turns each drawing one card from the common deck
					\item After a player draws, they have the option to play one side-deck card
					\item If ever a player's dealt cards sum to 20, they automatically fold and cannot take anymore turns
					\item Players can opt to fold (stop playing) at the end of their turn if their cards sum to less than 20
					\item If a player's turn ends and their score exceeds 20, they automatically lose the round
					\item The winning player of a round goes first in the next round
					\item If a tie occurs, the player who went second in the tied round goes first in the next round
					\item When starting a new round, discard any side-deck cards from play and reshuffle the common deck
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}

			\subsubsection{Required Items}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Common-card deck

				This deck consists of fourty cards, with four cards each of values from 1 to 10. It can be created by removing face cards from a deck of playing cards

				\item Side-card deck

				\begin{itemize}
					\item Plus Card: adds to the player's score, with values from 1 to 6; Set: $\{+1, +2, +3, +4, +5, +6\}$
					\item Minus Card: subtracts from the player's score, with values from 1 to 6; Set: $\{-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6\}$

					\item Flip Card: flips the sign of all cards of certain values already played by the player that plays this card, with values of 2 \& 4 and 3 \& 6; Set: $\{F2\&4, F3\&6\}$
					\item Multiplier: multiplies the value of the last played card by a value, withs values of 2 and 3; Set: $\{M2, M3\}$

				The Baltic region of Europa has maintained its cold climate, and its cold disposition. Outside of major settlements, a smattering of decrepit and ramshackle villages dot the landscape. While not outright hostile to outsiders, villagers are not forthcoming without significant displays of hospitality from visitors \linebreak

				Deep within the forests and mountains of the region, ancient science centers, missile silos, and other old-world installations persist in silence. Some still have their automatonian defenders still active, who shoot all intruders on sight, if they can see.
