			\section{Setting \& History}
			It is two millennia into the future. Humanity’s supremacy over Earth has dwindled, due largely in part to the Great Exodus and the onset of Era of Magic. The Exodus occurred sometime in the 25th century, where massive fleets of starships lifted off to relocate much of the human population following a grueling intrasystem war. Though successful in saving the species, it reduced the planetside human population from 3 billion to under 500 million. \linebreak

			As a result, many civilizations faded as those who remained clustered in non-equatorial coastal cities, as the Great Aridization was at its peak; temperatures in equatorial regions reached 140F on average, and many desert regions expanded and invaded at an unprecedented rate. Migration was so extreme that the American continent regained mythic status among some, as did Australia, North Africa, The Eurasian Steppe, and Antarctica, due to the lack of human presence there for the second half of the 2nd millennia. \vfill \null \columnbreak

			Though the human population did increase to around 1.5 billion by the 3rd millennia, so too did other populations. A combination of radioactive fallout from the multiple wars and accidents, and the awakening of magical forces, spurred the evolution of large mammals and small reptiles, which gave rise to Beast-Folk in the aforementioned abandoned continents. Though apprehensive at first, humans and beasts came to coexist in time, though xenophobia on both sides still resides in some circles. \linebreak

			As mentioned before, forces and powers once resigned to fiction began manifesting following the Exodus. A select group of humans and beasts were found to be able to shoot flames from thin air, lift objects without moving a finger, and heal all manner of diseases and wounds with a simple touch, and even turn themselves invisible. Though a rare feat, the five to ten percent of sentients capable of magic are overall benign, with the Order of International Mages holding sound dominion over all things arcane. \vfill \null \columnbreak

			Even with all the odd and amazing revelations of the past, much from the Era of Humans remains lost or undiscovered across the world. Many ancient bunkers remain, many from the 21st and 22nd centuries, and in near working order. Within their depths, armies of autonomous machines stand vigilant protecting the secrets of their creators, and, at times, do so aggressively. \linebreak

			They are not alone in their malevolence; Rogue mages, practitioners of necromancy or daemon communion, prowl the wastelands on the fringes of civilization; Feral Beast-Folk stalk the mountains, caves, and forests born anew after the Great Aridization; and, worst of all, certain “cursed” locations remain hotbeds for daemon interlopers, extra-dimensional aberrations that seek to kill or consume everything in their path. \linebreak

			Much awaits adventurers in this world, and in worlds beyond...
